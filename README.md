## **Computer Graphics Homework Project: Paint Simulation**
In this project, I developed a basic paint-like application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The application allows users to draw various shapes such as points, dots, lines, circles, and ellipses. It employs different algorithms including line segment, DDA, Bresenham, and implicit algorithms for rendering. Additionally, users can perform transformations on the shapes, making it a versatile tool for basic graphic design and algorithm demonstration.
